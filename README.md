# trails-sc-infinite-mira
A script that automates gaining infinite mira in Trails in the Sky SC

This assumes you have AutoHotkey installed.

# Usage
First, make sure you have the Turnin' Tempura recipe learned.

Next, go stand next to any merchant that sells ingredients.

Then, grab mira.ahk, run it, and hit the windows right click button on your keyboard.

It will, by default, attempt to run this loop 1000 times (which should be more than enough mira for anything - 20 loops is about 100k). Change the number or AFK, and enjoy!
